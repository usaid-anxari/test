# Business Registration Restrictions Implemented ✅

## 1. One Business Per User Restriction

### Backend Changes
- **File**: `backend/src/business/business.service.ts`
- **Added**: `hasExistingBusiness(userId: string)` method
- **Validation**: Checks if user already has any business before allowing creation

### Controller Validation
- **File**: `backend/src/business/business.controller.ts`
- **Added**: Pre-creation check for existing business
- **Error**: Returns `400 Bad Request` with message: "User already has a business. Only one business per user is allowed."

## 2. Email Validation

### Contact Email Validation
- **File**: `backend/src/business/business.controller.ts`
- **Validation**: Contact email must match Auth0 user email
- **Error**: Returns `400 Bad Request` with message: "Contact email must match your account email."

### DTO Validation
- **File**: `backend/src/business/dto/create-business.dto.ts`
- **Existing**: Email format validation using `@IsEmail()` decorator

## 3. Enhanced Auth0 Protected Route

### Improved Error Handling
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/Auth0ProtectedRoute.js`
- **Features**:
  - ✅ Timeout handling (8s for token, 5s for API)
  - ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff (max 2 retries)
  - ✅ Graceful fallback on API delays
  - ✅ User choice: retry or continue to setup

### Fallback Strategy
Instead of always redirecting to `/create-business` on API delays:

1. **Show Loading**: With retry counter
2. **On Timeout/Error**: Show error dialog with options:
   - "Retry Connection" - Refresh page
   - "Continue to Setup" - Go to create-business page
3. **User Control**: User decides next action instead of forced redirect

### Error States
- **Loading**: Shows spinner with retry info
- **API Error**: Shows connection issue dialog
- **Auth Error (401/404)**: Redirects to create-business
- **Network Timeout**: Offers retry or continue options

## 4. Business Creation Flow

### Validation Sequence
1. ✅ Check if user exists in system
2. ✅ Check if user already has a business (NEW)
3. ✅ Validate contact email matches Auth0 email (NEW)
4. ✅ Check slug uniqueness
5. ✅ Create business and set user as owner
6. ✅ Activate user account

### Error Messages
```javascript
// One business per user
"User already has a business. Only one business per user is allowed."

// Email mismatch
"Contact email must match your account email."

// Slug taken
"Slug already taken, choose another."
```

## 5. User Experience Improvements

### Loading States
- Shows retry counter during connection attempts
- Clear feedback on what's happening

### Error Recovery
- User can retry failed connections
- Option to continue with limited functionality
- No forced redirects on temporary network issues

### Graceful Degradation
- App remains accessible during API issues
- User maintains control over navigation
- Clear error messages with actionable options

## Implementation Summary

### Frontend Improvements:
